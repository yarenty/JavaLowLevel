/**
 * Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string. Return them as an array.
 * Don't worry about duplicates—assume every character is unique.
 * <p/>
 * Don't worry about time or space complexity—if we wanted efficiency we'd write an iterative version.
 * <p/>
 * Your function can have loops—it just needs to also be recursive.
